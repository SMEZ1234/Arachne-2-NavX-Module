ARACHNE NavX Module
=================
[Releases](https://github.com/Team4613-BarkerRedbacks/Arachne-NavX-Module/releases)

The Arachne library was created by 4613 to reduce the time and difficulty in programming FRC robots. It should reduce the required number of files for a complicated robot from over 100 to around 10.

This module contains all classes built on the [NavX libraries](https://www.pdocs.kauailabs.com/navx-mxp/software/roborio-libraries/java).

It also requires the [core Arachne library](https://github.com/Team4613-BarkerRedbacks/Arachne/releases).

RELEASE VERSION: Arachne 2.2.0-alpha (2018)
